# TensorflowMachineLearning
Here you can see some simple machine learning practice problems, solved using Tensorflow. Some of the tasks are inspired by online tutorials and are not my original ideas,
although the solutions and the code is written by me. All of the code is written with only educational purposes and is driven from my personal interest in the field af AI.
