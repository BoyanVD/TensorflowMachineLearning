# TensorflowMachineLearning
Here you can see some simple machine learning practice problems, solved using Tensorflow. Some of the tasks are inspired by online tutorials and are not my original ideas,
although the solutions and the code is written by me. All of the code is written with only educational purposes and is driven from my personal interest in the field af AI. 

# TensorflowMachineLearning
The folder contains introductional Tensorflow 2.x code, including some super basic algorithms, using mainly google's datasets.

# NeuralNetworks
Contains some more realistic tasks, containing data cleaning and preprocessing. The tasks solutions use Neural Networks.

# MachineLearningPractice
The folder contains some basic ML algorithms examples.

# SimpleChatBot
Simple chat bot based on neural network. The mini task idea comes from Tech With Tim's Youtube channel.

# FlappyBirdAI
Again the project idea comes from Tech With Tim's Youtube channel. Currently that's the most interesting project here. The taks inlcudes NEAT algorithm.
